4. Lewis mentioned that two sentences from the Problem Statement should be altered to better represent the sentiment of the project. These are “Our main priority according to our client is to create a searchable port for the project.” Essentially they should be augmented to accommodate the desire to (i) port the coal-sds software to the XSEDE platform and undertake test and evaluation of the system performance, (ii) process all AVIRIS and AVIRIS-NG imagery generating and archiving all science data products, and (iii) making the products searchable through a portal.
